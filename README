Frown, an LALR(k) Parser Generator for Haskell 98
=================================================

Version
-------

0.6 (beta release).

Prerequisites
-------------

You require a recent version of GHC, ie >=5.02 (due to some minor
changes to Haskell 98).

Installation (make)
-------------------

Edit the makefile to specify the destination directories for the
binary and the documentation.

make            compiles
make install	compiles and installs
make test	runs several tests (*)

(*) For `Loop.g' and `code=stackless' there is a known difference (the
generated parser is less strict than the standard one). Also,
`Empty.g' does not work yet. Finally, in the case of a syntax error
there may be a difference between optimized and unoptimized parsers if
monadic actions are involved (the former possibly executes more
reductions). So error reports may differ.

Installation (cabal)
--------------------

Alternatively, you can build Frown using Cabal (>=1.1.3, Haskell's
Common Architecture for Building Applications and Libraries).

Globally:

runhaskell Setup.hs configure --ghc
runhaskell Setup.hs build
runhaskell Setup.hs install

Locally:

runhaskell Setup.hs configure --ghc --prefix=$HOME
runhaskell Setup.hs build
runhaskell Setup.hs install --user

Usage
-----

The call

	frown -h

displays the various options to frown. For more information consult
the manual.

Happy frowning, Ralf Hinze
